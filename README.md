# resize.py
a python script using PIL that resizes images, by the folder, according to the user's specified width and height.


### Quick usage for the non-techsavvy:
1. Create a folder called "resizeme" in the same directory as the script, like your desktop.
2. Dump every image you have that you want to resize quickly into the resizeme folder.
3. In terminal/command prompt/whatever, navigate to your desktop by typing `cd desktop` and then type `python resize.py`
